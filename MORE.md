A tool to convert Commonjs files into ESM.

Advantage of using to-esm:

- You will not need to bundle your code in development (browser).
- You will not need a sourcemap in development (browser).
- The generated code looks almost as the same as your original code (all).
- You keep on writing CJS code then convert your code to ESM when needed.
