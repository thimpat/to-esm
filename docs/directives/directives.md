#### Directives allow more control over the generated code.

### Directives to replace code directly from the source.

You can, if you want, also use some to-esm directives within the code.
For instance, the code below will not appear when the target is a browser.

```javascript
/** to-esm-browser: remove **/
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");
const os = require("os");
/** to-esm-browser: end-remove **/
```

### Directives to add code to the source.

It is also possible to add code.

📝 code.cjs ↴
```javascript
/** to-esm-browser: add
    this.realConsoleLog("LogToFile is not supported in this environment. ")
* **/
```

In this example, after conversion, the above code will become this:

📝 code.mjs (with target browser) ↴
```javascript
this.realConsoleLog("LogToFile is not supported in this environment. ")
```

### Directives to ignore code during the parsing, so it won't be converted by mistake.

```javascript
/** to-esm-all: skip **/
console.log("Skip this");
/** to-esm-all: end-skip **/
```
